Startup of SAGI in GIT at 19.5.2019.

This relatively old project of mine is a private excercise for an adventure game engine. It is currently by far not complete, and for various parts there is need for refactoring, as some solutions are not quite the best even for my purposes. Although the main purpose is just to rehearse some Java here - if I'd only want to make a game, I should just use Unity or some other pre-made game engine instead of examining how to make one myself.

The project is made with NetBeans IDE, which also is prone to make certain files to have quite awkward code order plus generated code parts are obviously cute as minced meat in a blender. But it makes project management and most of all GUI window management much more convenient, which obviously is the purpose of using an IDE instead of plain editor.
